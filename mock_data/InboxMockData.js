  The event was great, but the seating arrangements could be improved. Overall, I was impressed with the organization and execution of the Champions League event last weekend.
  
  However, I did notice a few areas where improvements could be made:
  - The VIP seating area was a bit cramped
  - Some guests had difficulty finding their assigned seats
  - The view from section C was partially obstructed
  
  Despite these minor issues, the event was fantastic and I look forward to attending future events.
  
  Best regards,

  There's been a slight change to the performance timing. Please review the updated schedule and let me know if this works for the event flow.
  
  **Updated Performance Schedule:**
  - Sound check: 3:00 PM - 3:30 PM
  - Opening act: 7:00 PM - 7:45 PM
  - Main performance: 8:15 PM - 9:45 PM
  - Encore (if requested): 9:45 PM - 10:00 PM
  
  The change is due to additional technical requirements for the lighting setup. We'll need an extra 15 minutes between the opening act and main performance.
  
  I hope this adjustment doesn't cause any issues with your overall event timeline. Please let me know if you need any additional information.
  
  Thank you for your understanding.
